# PS_2Mouse_SwipeLight
A small code that runs on an Arduino (actually a NodeMCU) which allows you to use an old mouse with PS2 attach (with red laser) 
WITHOUT external hardware (except for a LED ,or 5v led strips(much more cool, with same code) and cables of course) to set the power of the led(s)
just passing over the hand (like Daniel-San, u know...) on the mouse sensor.
